        <h2>The reality behind homelessness :</h2>
        <p>
            Homelessness is a form of social exclusion, which exposes a large number of people to the
            dangers of starvation and extreme poverty. The severe obstacles that support this condition
            include a conspicuous lack of readily available healthcare resources which are further
            exacerbated by the weight of prohibitive expenses leading to detrimental effects on mental
            health.
            The social gradient of health is a social hierarchy where those who have high socioeconomic
            status experience healthier outcomes in terms of their health and wellbeing, whereas those
            at the bottom such as the homeless population tend to experience poorer health outcomes.
            Because efforts to reduce health inequalities have not succeeded, many are suffering from
            mental health issues and diseases, which can later lead to substance abuse. Furthermore,
            the majority of homeless people tend to sleep in busy streets where they are the most
            vulnerable and defenceless to the people around them, as they don’t have direct access to
            basic needs this can make it difficult for them to live a healthier lifestyle Cuthill (2019).
            Homeless individuals experience elevated rates of morbidity due to medical illness and drug
            abuse, compared to a socioeconomic advantaged person, they are likely to encounter more
            obstacles to accessing health care which results in greater stress and as a result generating
            health problems Jayawardana and Mossialos (2020).</p>
            <p><b>“Homelessness is a profound assault on dignity, social inclusion and the right to life. It is a
                prima facie violation to the right to life, including non-discrimination, health, water and
                sanitation, security of the person and freedom from cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment”
                from United Nations Human.</b></p>

            <p>The prevalence of homelessness continues to rise worldwide and has become a global issue.<br> There were approximately 100 million people that were homeless in 2005, in more recent data in 2021 the World Economic Forum estimated that 150 million people were homeless worldwide Susmita et al. (2024).</p>

            <h2>Homelessness in Australia and Victoria:</h2>
            <p>
                 In the year 2021, approximately 122,000 Australians were considered homeless, the majority were male aged between 25-34 and 20% were identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. There is a high prevalence of homelessness in the Northern Territory compared to the Western part of Australia. 
                
                Homelessness can have various impacts on the health of the individual as well as society. In a recent study that was done in urban centres, it portrayed the daily struggles that homeless people experience, for example they tend to have difficulty getting access to basic medical treatment, and many turn to the use of substance abuse as a way to cope Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW,2024),
                
                In Victoria alone approximately 30,000 people were homeless and the main reason being was due to financial hardship (homelessness facts,stats, and insight, n.d.).
