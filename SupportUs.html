                <h1>Call to Action</h1>

                    <p>Breaking the cycle of homelessness requires action on multiple levels. At a personal level, individuals need access to healthcare, support for mental health and addiction issues, and safe, affordable housing (Dorney‐Smith et al., 2021). 

                     </p> A societal level, there needs to be more affordable housing options, better welfare systems, and increased support for people exiting homelessness (Brown & Mueller, 2014). By learning about these issues, you can develop a deeper understanding and empathy for those affected by homelessness.
                      <p>
                     You have the power to make a real difference! By taking small but meaningful actions, you can help change lives. Start by volunteering at local shelters, standing up for better housing options, and using your voice to spread the message that homelessness is a crisis we can’t ignore. Every step you take brings us closer to creating a world where everyone has a safe place to call home.<p>
